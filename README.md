# HueMalang
HueMalang: High utility engine for Malicious Language detection at different hierarchies of a network leveraging optimised LLMs in production 

**Purpose:**
The true successor to Malang, HueMalang is trained on over 10+ languages across the Indian Subcontinent, utilising dataset that contains slangs, dialect and informal figures of speech. While the ultimate aim of HueMalang is to tackle textual toxicity at various levels, we aspire to expand its capabilites to text censoring and subsequent alternate in-text masking.

**Current status:** 
At the moment, HueMalang has taken shape from ROBERTA, CTRL and ALBERT. More LLMs are under due consideration, and the best two will be considered based on their performance metrics in scenarios such as production and bias.
